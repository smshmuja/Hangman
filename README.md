# Hangman: The Sunset Edition

Welcome to Hangman: The Sunset Edition, a unique twist on the classic word-guessing game. This project, contained within `Hangman_SAM.ipynb`, introduces a visually engaging and thematic element to Hangman, where each incorrect guess brings you closer to nightfall, symbolizing the dwindling chances of saving your hangman.

## Features

- **Visual Hangman Progression**: Utilizes ASCII art to visually represent the stages of the hangman's plight, enhancing the traditional gameplay experience with each incorrect guess.
- **Sunset Stages**: A thematic addition where the game's progress is mirrored by the stages of a sunset, from bright daylight to the dark of night, adding a poetic dimension to the race against time.
- **Case Sensitivity Option**: Offers players the choice to play in a case-sensitive mode for an added challenge, or a case-insensitive mode for a more relaxed experience.
- **Diverse Word List**: Includes a curated list of words spanning various technical and analytical terms, from "Algorithm" to "Z-Score," making it both educational and entertaining.

## How to Play

4. **Save the Hangman**: Correctly guess the word before the sunset ends to save the hangman and win the game!
